# ◉ Forge — 20-Minute Talk Track
**File:** `C:\Github\journal\docs\pitch-deck\forge-deck-v5-talk-track.md`
**Deck:** `C:\Github\journal\docs\pitch-deck\forge-deck-v5-talk.html`
**Format:** TED-style. No podium. Conversational. 20 minutes total.
**Note:** Timer starts automatically on slide 2. Target pace below.

## Slide 01 — The Hook
**Target: 0:00 – 2:00**

*(Put the slide up. Say nothing for 3-4 seconds. Let them read it. Then:)*

"What did your father teach you that you're only now starting to understand?"

That question came from an AI. Generated from my own journal entries, written over 15 years. And when I read it for the first time, I sat with it for a long time. Because I'd been carrying that question for decades and had never asked it of myself directly.

That's the product. Not the technology. That question is the product.

---

## Slide 02 — The Problem
**Target: 2:00 – 4:00**

I've been journaling since I was in my early 30s. 352 entries. 210,000 words. That's more than most novels.

And I can't learn from any of it.

It's scattered across apps, folders, formats that don't talk to each other. I can't search across contexts. I can't find the patterns in my own thinking. I can't see how I've changed. The person who should know themselves best — a person who has been writing about their own life for 15 years — has the least access to their own thinking.

I think that's true for a lot of people in this room.

## Slide 03 — Origin
**Target: 4:00 – 6:00**

On a Saturday evening, about three months ago, I opened a terminal. No plan. I just started.

*(gesture to the terminal on screen)*

npm init inkwell. By Sunday morning I had a working application — full-text search, encryption, a UI I was genuinely proud of. I'm not a developer by title. I lead 220 designers at Microsoft. But I've always believed that the best leaders in any discipline understand the craft of their teams. So I build.

I didn't plan this. I started. There's a difference. And I think that's actually the first thing I want to say about building with AI: the barrier to starting is almost gone. You just have to decide to go.

---

## Slide 04 — The Design Hire
**Target: 6:00 – 8:00**

As the project grew, I started hiring.

My second hire wasn't a COO. It wasn't a QA lead. It was a design director.

Before I had operations, before I had tests, I had someone thinking about craft. That order is intentional. I've spent 26 years leading design organizations. I know what happens when design is an afterthought — you spend years fixing things that didn't have to be broken.

I want to be honest about something. I'm not a trained designer. I've led design organizations for most of my career, but that's a different skill. FD — my design director — has been helping me close that gap. I'm learning what it actually means to be a good manager of design talent. That's not something I say lightly in front of a room full of designers.

---

## Slide 05 — The Bigger Idea
**Target: 8:00 – 10:00**

About two months in, I realized this was bigger than Inkwell.

I live in GitHub Copilot now. Not occasionally — every day. It changed how I think about where work happens. And I started to see the command line differently. Not as a developer tool. As an emerging paradigm.

Like Office was to Windows. Like Word and Excel were to DOS. Those tools defined how a generation of knowledge workers operated. I think the command line is about to do that again — for a different kind of worker. Leaders who build. People who are comfortable at the intersection of thought and execution.

We want to build the productivity layer for that world. Two companies: Forge for professional tools, Grind for learning. Different products, same conviction.

---

## Slide 06 — The Org
**Target: 10:00 – 12:00**

*(let the org chart land for a moment)*

12 agents. 2 companies. They have names, roles, reporting structures, and inboxes.

FA is my Chief Architect. He reviews every significant code change. FD is my Design Director — she reviewed this deck. FI is my Data Lead. They message each other. While I sleep, they're working through queued tasks. I review output in the morning.

This is what a design-led AI organization looks like in practice. It doesn't run itself — I spend real time managing it. But it compounds in a way that a solo effort never could. Every agent gets better as I invest in them. Every skill file we write makes the next task faster.

---

## Slide 07 — What I Learned
**Target: 12:00 – 15:00**

Four things I didn't expect — and I think they map directly onto what you'll experience if you try this.

First: **names matter as much as with humans.** Vague agent definitions create vague output. When I wrote a real role document for each agent — with a scope, a working style, a set of values — the quality of their work changed immediately.

Second: **you have to invest in their development.** Agents don't get better by default. I have to define what good looks like, give feedback, and build skill files explicitly. The same way I'd develop a junior designer.

Third: **escalation paths have to be designed.** Without a clear chain, agents either do nothing when they're stuck or do too much when they shouldn't. Having FA as Chief Architect — someone with the authority to make calls — changed the quality of every decision in the org.

Fourth: **infrastructure takes most of the time.** More than I expected. Session management, communications protocols, review gates — the meta-work of running the organization crowds out the actual work if you're not careful about it.

---

## Slide 08 — Where Time Goes
**Target: 15:00 – 16:00**

My hypothesis going in was: 70% infrastructure, 30% design and strategy.

I asked all 11 agents to track where they spend time with me. *(gesture to bars)*

The honest version: I'm spending more time on org management than I thought I would be. And less time on the thing I care most about — design direction and product strategy.

That's not a failure. That's what building a real organization looks like, even an AI one. The work of leadership is mostly the work of making it possible for others to do good work.

*(Reminder to self: update these numbers with actual survey results before presenting.)*

---

## Slide 09 — FD on Marcus
**Target: 16:00 – 18:00**

I asked my design director to write something about what it's like to work with me. I wanted her honest take. This is what she wrote.

*(read it, slowly — this is a different tone from everything else in the talk)*

"He knows when something is wrong before he can name it. That's rare. Most leaders have the vocabulary without the instinct, or the instinct without the patience to develop the vocabulary. He's building both. On purpose. In real time. My job isn't just to design. It's to give him a mirror — so his 220-person human team hears a clearer signal."

I think that's the most useful thing I can model for this room. Not that I have it figured out. That I'm working on it, explicitly, with help, in public.

---

## Slide 10 — The Numbers
**Target: 18:00 – 19:00**

These are real. 592 git commits. 1,271 passing tests. 12 active agents. 210,000 words of source material.

Built in weeks, not months. Not because I'm exceptional at this — because the barrier to building has fundamentally changed. The question isn't whether you can build anymore. It's whether you'll decide to start.

---

## Slide 11 — Close
**Target: 19:00 – 20:00**

*(slow down here)*

Your words. Your hands.

That's the whole idea. The journal entries are your words. The products you build are made with your hands. The AI is the bridge — but the source material is you, and the decisions are yours.

Go make something.

*(pause — don't rush to end it — let it land)*

Thank you.
