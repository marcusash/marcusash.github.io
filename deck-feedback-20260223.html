He said the Forge logo itself looks nice but that globe icon sitting next to it is a problem and should be fixed. This is the same issue we worked through in the TUI canvas session: in Edge App Mode the taskbar icon is the Edge process (unfixable in Phase 1), but the browser tab favicon IS controllable via the HTML link rel icon tag. The globe is showing because the deck does not currently set a custom favicon. It should show the Circuit F mark in Maize.</div>

He wants one slide that captures the full why: what drove him to start this, what problem he is solving, and why he chose this particular approach at this particular time. The rationale for Forge needs to land in one hit, not be spread across two slides that the audience treats as one anyway. The combined slide should give the audience a complete answer to "why are you doing this?" before moving forward. He wants to see five different approaches to telling this story — different angles, different emphasis, different emotional entry points.</div>

That date is not just a technical correction — it is a meaningful storytelling detail. Valentine's Day is a memorable, emotionally resonant anchor. "I started building this organization on Valentine's Day" is a better story hook than a generic date. Marcus wants the benchmark numbers (commit velocity, output volume) all anchored to Valentine's Day. He also said as long as we set February 14th as the benchmark, we can re-run these numbers at any time and they will be accurate. He wants 3 variant approaches to telling the origin story with this corrected timeline.</div>

The "220 designers" framing — referring to his professional background leading a 220-person design organization at Microsoft — is a powerful credential but it needs to be framed correctly. The point is not just that he has managed designers. The point is that his entire career has been about understanding how great design gets made, what separates good from exceptional, and how creative teams operate at their best. That lived experience is now being applied to building an AI organization. The design background is the lens through which everything else in this deck is seen. He wants 5 design variants of the slide layout, and separately, 5 language variants that explore different ways of framing what design experience contributes to building with AI.</div>

The CLI is the actual working environment — it is not an incidental technical choice, it is the deliberate design surface that shapes how agents communicate, how work gets tracked, and how the organization operates. The tagline should capture this. He is not prescriptive about the exact language but wants to explore options that make the AI-plus-CLI combination feel intentional and powerful rather than just "we used terminal tools."</div>

He is skeptical that a 13-agent team could produce more commits per week than VS Code does with 1,800 contributors. He said "the math doesn't add up here" and wants FR to really think about this carefully before it stays in the deck. He also said the color scheme on this slide has issues: the company Maize yellow is being used somewhere it should not be, and separately a different color is showing that he actually liked. The 13-agent text is not readable because it is too small. He wants to stop comparing to VS Code specifically and instead find a comparison that shows our commit rate versus a healthy, well-run engineering team of a comparable size. The question he wants answered is: what is the ratio of our velocity to what you would expect from a normal high-performing team at this size? He also said the tilde (~60%) or approximation language should be removed if we are not confident in the numbers — he would rather say nothing than say something that an audience member can debunk. He is also looking for 8-day window framing to go away since the benchmark is now Valentine's Day and we can re-run at any time.</div>
          <div class="story-quote">"VS Code has 1800 contributors and we think we made more commits than they make with only less than 1800. I'm struggling to see that that would be true so the math doesn't add up here. Please have FR really think about this."</div>

He has a lot of space on the slide and wants the number formatted so the relationship between the parts is visually clear. The decimal should not be the separator that gets lost.

          <div class="story-text">The Grind section needs a full story arc, not just a slide. Marcus wants the narrative to flow naturally from Forge's success. The story goes like this: Forge was going well. The agent methodology was working. Marcus started to ask: where else can this apply? His deepest personal motivation outside of Forge is helping his kids. His very first-day project before Forge even existed was building a rudimentary HTML site for his son. That instinct — to use technology to help his son learn — never went away. Now that Forge had proven the agent approach, Marcus asked: could the same methodology help with personalized learning? Could a team of agents help him help his son? His son became the focus because (a) Marcus had already started there on day one and (b) the challenge felt real, personal, and urgent. From there, Marcus decided to create a second organization underneath Forge. He named it Grind — because it takes grind to be a great student, to really learn, to push through hard material. Grind is not a spin-off. It is a subsidiary. That distinction matters because Forge agents and Grind agents share the same feedback infrastructure, the same cultural protocols, the same critique systems. The learning flows both ways. Grind benefits from everything Forge built. And interestingly, Grind is teaching Forge new things about what it means to distribute knowledge and skill across an organization. The name itself is part of the story: Forge is about forging products. Grind is about grinding through the work of becoming your best self.</div>

On day one, before Forge existed as a formal concept, Marcus's first actual project was building a basic HTML site to help his son. That instinct — that the AI tools he was playing with could be useful for his kid — was there from the beginning. When Forge proved that agents could build real things at real quality, Marcus came back to that original instinct. The application to education felt natural. And the passion Marcus has for helping people — not just building products but genuinely making people better — is a through-line in his work. Grind is the application of that passion. The point he wants to make: the best way to get started with AI is to pick something you are deeply passionate about and go build. He was passionate about Forge. He is equally passionate about his son. Both are evidence of the same lesson.</div>

One key insight Marcus had: Grind helped the whole organization figure out what it means to distribute and share learning between agent teams. Forge had built a great internal learning system (memories, skill docs, evals). But Grind created the challenge of: how do we take everything we know and pour it into a brand new team? How do agents mentor agents across organizational boundaries? This turned out to be a key cultural insight. Knowledge transfer between agent teams is not automatic. It requires deliberate design. The memory system, the shared protocol files, the sprint handoff docs — all of these became more important, and better, because of Grind's onboarding challenge. Marcus wants to close the Grind section by acknowledging: we came in thinking we were building a study tool. We ended up learning something fundamental about how organizations distribute knowledge.</div>

The visual and language tools that got built (the canvas system, the feedback protocol, the deck review process they just did) are evidence of this working style in action. He uses the TUI as an entry point but the real design surface is the canvas. He gives feedback verbally and the agents compile it. He does not write long specs — he reacts and iterates. He communicates through screenshots, voice, and quick questions. The agents have learned to read between the lines.

All the writing Marcus has done in his life — his notes, his journals, his reflections — were the source material that trained and informed his voice. Now, in five days of building Forge, he has already generated output equal to roughly 10% of that 15-year total volume. That is a shocking stat. He wants the combined slide to tell that story: here is where the input came from (15 years of writing), here is what the output looks like after 5 days (10% of lifetime volume). The ratio is the argument. He also said comparing the total volume directly is more powerful than comparing a daily rate — just show the total amounts and let the proportions speak.

The agents themselves proposed the most significant parts of the cultural system, and then Marcus watched them build it. He finds that remarkable. The slide needs to capture two distinct components of what got built. The first is the feedback and critique system: a rich, structured way of exchanging honest, rigorous feedback between Marcus and the agents, and between agents themselves. The second is the infrastructure and quality system: the test coverage, the mutation testing, the sprint protocols, the eval framework. These were built from day one, not retrofitted. Marcus wants to always frame these as "the operating system of the organization" — the culture is the OS. Building an organization requires getting the OS right. They applied that principle to agents. Marcus also wants to note that the most interesting part of his journey was that what started as "we're going to build an app" turned into "we're building an organization with a culture."

He described this as a slide where "we come back to this theme of our product — two things: it's the culture and it's the products." The culture side needs a dedicated slide that articulates the principles they have established. He said he and FD should brainstorm this together — he did not want to dictate the list, he wants it to be a collaborative statement. The principles should emerge from what actually happened in building Forge: the feedback system, the quality discipline from the start, the visual communication tools, the eval process for agents, the idea that every agent has a voice and contributes to organizational learning. This is not a list of values written by an HR department. It is a list of practices that emerged from 6 days of real work and proved themselves.</div>

For each product he wants three things: the core value proposition, the promise (what it delivers to a real person), and the targeted launch date. He specified that launch dates should be in weeks, not months — the timeline is aggressive and he wants to communicate that. He was very specific about the design direction for this slide: all text should be neutral (no agent colors, no product colors driving the text), and the only color used should be the product iconography. The icons carry the color identity. Everything else reads in neutral tones. This makes the slide scannable and prevents color overload. He also mentioned that if MCM and Chemistry icons do not already exist in the library, FD needs to build them. MCM has a parabola/M mark. Chemistry has a bond mark (two connected circles). Both in Purple (#A78BFA) since they are Grind-family products.</div>

          <div class="story-text">Marcus dictated four pieces of advice he wants to share with others. Each one pairs a lesson learned with a specific resource — something actionable that the reader can use immediately. The four pieces he described: (1) Train your agents to have a self-critique process. Resource: whatever he used to set this up — likely the self-critique protocol in the skill docs. (2) Look at things visually and have a simple way to exchange visual information. Resource: how he set up canvas on his machine — the canvas.ps1 script and the App Mode approach. (3) Always be working to understand what your pitch is. Have an active working pitch deck and know how to get it into PowerPoint. Resource: the pitch deck template and the pptx export script. (4) Interview your agents. Develop a process for running evals, taking someone else's agent files, and tuning them to your voice. Resource: the eval runner and the interview process developed for FR. Marcus said: "this deck, thank you for reading, here's what I've learned, here's a resource you can use right away." The slide should be simple, pithy, and immediately useful. A reader should be able to take any one of these four and go do it tomorrow.</div>

Several sessions ago they talked about this idea that the only way to really do this — to lead a team, to learn in public, to navigate a world where everyone is trying to figure out AI — is to make things. To build. To set the example by making, not by managing from a distance. Marcus's parting shot is this: "Let's go out there and make things." The only way to build an organization, the only way to learn everything there is to learn in this moment where AI is something we are all figuring out together, is to be a maker. To produce. To ship. To fail and ship again. He said "here's to the makers" and that should be the last thing in the deck. Not a contact slide, not a "thank you," not a URL. A declaration. Something that makes the audience feel they want to go build something the moment they leave the room.</div>

          <div class="story-text">Marcus reviewed a quote slide and said he loves the quote itself but the formatting is bad. He then described exactly what he wants for all quote slides in the deck. The quote needs stylized quotation marks — actual designed quotation glyphs, large and prominent, not the default straight tick marks. The quote must be attributed: who said it. The color of the quote text should match that person's canonical agent color. The color dot at the bottom (or wherever the attribution lockup sits) should also match that person's color. And the full speaker lockup should appear: the agent's name, their mark/icon, and their role. He said "really take the time to design these things" — quote slides are not an afterthought, they are moments. They should feel like a significant pause in the presentation, not a filler slide.</div>
