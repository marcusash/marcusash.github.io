<div class="page-eyebrow">Greg Cox, Feb 24 2026</div>
<h1>Feedback synthesis</h1>
<p class="page-sub">All 12 steps captured. Themes, Marcus additions, and a new discussion guide below.</p>

<!-- SECTION 1: ALL FEEDBACK BY SLIDE -->
<div class="section">
  <div class="section-label">Greg's feedback, slide by slide</div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">The email</div>
    <div class="slide-text">Did not sound exactly like Marcus's voice. The salutation was "bro" which Marcus would not say. He would say "brother." It also referred to "we" for dinner, which was odd. Otherwise nit-picking. It was pretty good.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 1: Why this conversation</div>
    <div class="slide-text">First thought: really stylized, almost too formal as a pre-read. I was not entirely sure what the goal was at this point. The framing was not clear.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 2: The Forge deck</div>
    <div class="slide-text">Deferred. Took a quick look. Said he would review the full deck later with Marcus.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 3: What Forge is</div>
    <div class="slide-text">Format felt pitchy with the numbers, architecture decisions, that sort of thing. Feels a little salesy. It could be fewer words and more conceptual. The key takeaway was implicit, not explicit. If you want me to take something away, put it in the title. Also: the deck dives right into a solution without me truly understanding the problem being solved. My main question throughout: how does a multi-agent system fit into my workflows where I have a multi-human team today? How do those two work together? That was the main thing I was thinking throughout this deck.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 4: The hard problems</div>
    <div class="slide-text">This is telling me as the customer what my problems are. I would expect the deck to be trying to figure out from me what the problems are. That annoyed me a little. The language reads like a LinkedIn post. Almost too well-written and vaguely annoying. The first sentence, <em>"The tooling works. What is hard is organizational"</em>, is very opinionated. I thought it was my opinion you needed, but this is just throwing an opinion at me. I do think the hard problems are technical, but also organizational and communication. Figuring out the place AI has in workflows between humans and agents.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 5: Communication system</div>
    <div class="slide-text">The slide is taking up a small part of the screen. Text is pretty small. I maximized my laptop and it is still hard to read. Too much negative space. Readability and legibility are a big deal here. On the content: I am interested in how agents communicate with each other. But this is a low-level technical detail. I am more interested in the high-level: how does this fit into my world as a whole? It feels siloed. Like Marcus and a bunch of agents work alone, then somehow interface with the rest of a team. What I want to know is: if each of my team members had a bunch of agents, how are all of those agents communicating with each other and with human team members? It is a high-level organizational problem. How do agents fit into a human organization that is multiple humans, not a single human?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 6: Live prototyping</div>
    <div class="slide-text">At this point I started to get anxiety about what I would actually ask Marcus to build. None of the things I was really concerned about seemed conducive to prototyping something live. My real problems are things like: figuring out how to get all of my systems connected so AI has context, whether that is from Fathom, Slack, email, or Google Docs. All the problems I thought of were too complex. I could not think of something simple enough that I imagined we could live prototype in the session.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 7: Recruiting agents</div>
    <div class="slide-text">Very interesting concept. But I worry we will anthropomorphize agents too much, applying too many things we learned from recruiting humans. Evaluating agents for specific tasks should maybe be done differently. That said, I do find the concept genuinely interesting: that you would evaluate agents for tasks and then select one. That is a good idea.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 8: Three things Marcus wants</div>
    <div class="slide-text">These three questions are quite ambitious. Each one is very deep with a lot to convey. As the person consuming the presentation, it is hard to read it all and feel like you are doing the right thing. The presentation sometimes makes me feel dumb. There is too much going on. It is asking too much from me. Stylistically still too many words with tiny letters, even maximized. And at this point in the process it feels too soon to be asking what I have changed my mind about. It just seems too ambitious.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 9: Three things to bring</div>
    <div class="slide-text">This slide was really clear. Still too small and hard to read, but the content worked. It was clear on what I had to do beforehand. So it worked.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 10: 90 minutes</div>
    <div class="slide-text class-none">No comment.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide-row">
    <div class="slide-label">Slide 11: Say it out loud</div>
    <div class="slide-text">I like the sentiment but it represents something about the whole deck. It feels very stylized. Things are too small to read. A very stylized designed slide puts pressure on me. It does not put me at ease. It makes me feel I need to live up to a stylized expectation. If you are doing user research, you want to be low-key and put someone at ease. Low-key would make me feel more at ease and put me in a better position to contribute.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- SECTION 2: GREG'S THEMES -->
<div class="section">
  <div class="section-label">Key themes from Greg</div>

  <div class="theme-card">
    <div class="theme-num">Theme 01</div>
    <div class="theme-title">The deck is built for Marcus's world, not Greg's.</div>
    <div class="theme-body">Greg's central question from slide 3 through slide 5 was the same: how does a multi-agent system fit into a multi-human organization? He has a team, not a solo operation. Every slide answered the question "what did Marcus build?" when Greg's question was "what would this do for my 15-person team?" The deck never addressed the gap between a single-human agent system and a company with multiple humans each potentially using agents.</div>
    <div class="theme-evidence">Slides 3, 5: "How does a multi-agent system fit into my workflows where I have a multi-human team today?" and "Multiple humans, not a single human."</div>
  </div>

  <div class="theme-card">
    <div class="theme-num">Theme 02</div>
    <div class="theme-title">Readability failed on every single slide.</div>
    <div class="theme-body">Greg flagged legibility issues on slides 5, 8, 9, and 11. He maximized his laptop and still could not read the text. Too much negative space. Too many tiny letters. This is not an aesthetic note. It is a usability failure. The deck looks like design and does not function as communication. Greg is analytical and patient. If he mentioned it four times, it cost him significant effort to read at all.</div>
    <div class="theme-evidence">Slides 5, 8, 9, 11: "Text is pretty small," "tiny letters that are difficult for me to read even when I maximize the screen," "still too small and hard to read."</div>
  </div>

  <div class="theme-card">
    <div class="theme-num">Theme 03</div>
    <div class="theme-title">The deck tells. Greg expected to be asked.</div>
    <div class="theme-body">Slide 4 asserts "The tooling works. What is hard is organizational." Greg disagrees. He thinks the hard problems are technical AND organizational. He did not feel invited to share that view. The deck is opinionated where it should be curious. Greg came with real thoughts and found the materials had already decided what the answers were.</div>
    <div class="theme-evidence">Slide 4: "This is telling me as the customer what my problems are. I would expect the deck to be trying to figure out from me what the problems are. That annoyed me a little."</div>
  </div>

  <div class="theme-card">
    <div class="theme-num">Theme 04</div>
    <div class="theme-title">High production creates performance pressure, not ease.</div>
    <div class="theme-body">Greg named it explicitly on slide 11: the stylized design made him feel he needed to "live up to it." Slides 1 and 8 reinforced the same feeling. When you over-design a pre-read for a peer conversation, you signal formality. For user research, that is exactly backwards. The design should put the guest at ease, not signal that the host is impressively polished.</div>
    <div class="theme-evidence">Slide 11: "It makes me feel I also need to live up to this stylized expectation." Slide 1: "Almost too formal." Slide 8: "Sometimes makes me feel dumb."</div>
  </div>

  <div class="theme-card">
    <div class="theme-num">Theme 05</div>
    <div class="theme-title">The live prototype demo does not fit Greg's actual problems.</div>
    <div class="theme-body">Greg got anxious on slide 6 because his real problems are too complex to prototype live: connecting Fathom, Slack, email, and Google Docs to give AI context across his org. These are integration-scale, architectural problems. The demo premise assumes someone has a simple, isolatable problem ready to go. Greg does not have that kind of problem. The demo as framed would not work for him.</div>
    <div class="theme-evidence">Slide 6: "All the problems I thought of were too complex. I could not think of something simple enough that I imagined we could live prototype."</div>
  </div>

  <div class="theme-card">
    <div class="theme-num">Theme 06</div>
    <div class="theme-title">The problem statement is missing entirely.</div>
    <div class="theme-body">Greg could not answer "what is this solving?" The deck opens with what Forge is and what it does. It never states the human problem it exists to address. For Greg, that made the whole thing feel like a solution looking for a problem. He is an analytical thinker. He needs the problem named clearly before he can evaluate whether the solution is the right one.</div>
    <div class="theme-evidence">Slide 3: "It is diving right into a solution without me truly understanding what the problem is." Added explicitly by Greg after the session.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="theme-card">
    <div class="theme-num">Theme 07</div>
    <div class="theme-title">One sharp intellectual interest: agents in multi-human orgs.</div>
    <div class="theme-body">Greg is not dismissing AI. He is asking a genuinely hard question that the deck never addressed: if each person on a team had a set of agents, how do all those agents coordinate with each other and with the humans? He is thinking about this as an organizational design problem at scale. That is a more sophisticated question than most people bring. It deserves to be the center of the conversation, not a footnote.</div>
    <div class="theme-evidence">Slide 5: "If each of my team members had a bunch of agents, how are all of those agents communicating with each other and with other team members? It is a high-level organizational problem."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- SECTION 3: MARCUS THEMES -->
<div class="section">
  <div class="section-label">Marcus additions</div>

  <div class="marcus-card">
    <div class="marcus-tag">Marcus</div>
    <div class="marcus-text">Less stylized, more real. Talk more human.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="marcus-card">
    <div class="marcus-tag">Marcus</div>
    <div class="marcus-text">Fewer slides. Smaller, more focused things to discuss.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- SECTION 4: WHAT CHANGES -->
<div class="section">
  <div class="section-label">What changes for the next conversation</div>

  <div class="change-card">
    <div class="change-num">01</div>
    <div class="change-body">
      <div class="change-text">Cut from 11 slides to 3 or 4. Maximum.</div>
      <div class="change-why">Greg processed everything and still felt overloaded. He had quality thoughts on every slide and that cost him. Fewer slides means more energy per topic and a better conversation.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="change-card">
    <div class="change-num">02</div>
    <div class="change-body">
      <div class="change-text">Make text large enough to read on a maximized laptop without effort.</div>
      <div class="change-why">Greg flagged this four times. It is not a preference. It is a prerequisite for the materials to function at all. Minimum 20px body. Generous line height. No dense paragraphs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="change-card">
    <div class="change-num">03</div>
    <div class="change-body">
      <div class="change-text">Replace assertions with open questions. Every declarative slide becomes a prompt.</div>
      <div class="change-why">Greg came with opinions that the deck had already decided were wrong. Slide 4 is the sharpest example. Reframe every slide as a question the conversation is trying to answer together.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="change-card">
    <div class="change-num">04</div>
    <div class="change-body">
      <div class="change-text">Drop the high-design treatment. Plain, warm, generous whitespace only.</div>
      <div class="change-why">The stylized design registered as pressure. For a peer exchange, that is a failure mode. The materials should feel like a thoughtful note from a peer, not a portfolio piece from a designer.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="change-card">
    <div class="change-num">05</div>
    <div class="change-body">
      <div class="change-text">Reframe the conversation around Greg's world, not Marcus's.</div>
      <div class="change-why">The entire pre-read described Forge. Greg's core question is how agents fit into a multi-human org. Lead with his question, not Marcus's answer.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="change-card">
    <div class="change-num">06</div>
    <div class="change-body">
      <div class="change-text">Remove the live prototype demo as a centerpiece. Make it optional at the end.</div>
      <div class="change-why">Greg's real problems are too complex to prototype in a session. The demo premise creates anxiety, not excitement. If a demo happens, it should emerge naturally from the conversation.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="change-card">
    <div class="change-num">07</div>
    <div class="change-body">
      <div class="change-text">Lead with the problem statement. One sentence before anything else.</div>
      <div class="change-why">Greg could not locate the problem Forge is solving. Every other change depends on this one. If Greg does not know what problem is being solved, he cannot evaluate whether agents are the answer for his team.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

</div>

<!-- SECTION 5: NEW DISCUSSION GUIDE -->
<div class="section">
  <div class="section-label">New discussion guide for the next conversation</div>
  <p class="guide-intro">Three topics. No assertions. Greg's question is at the center. Send as plain text, not a deck. Greg reads in 5 minutes.</p>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <div class="guide-eyebrow">Opening, first 10 minutes</div>
    <div class="guide-title">Start with the problem, not the solution.</div>
    <div class="guide-qs">
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>What problem are you actually trying to solve with AI right now at ExpertVoice? Name it specifically.</li>
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>Marcus names the problem Forge was built to solve: one person, more leverage, faster output, without losing quality or control. Does that problem resonate? Is Greg's problem the same or different?</li>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-note">Greg explicitly said the deck never named the problem. Start here. Everything else follows from whether the problems match.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <div class="guide-eyebrow">Topic 1, 25 minutes</div>
    <div class="guide-title">How do agents work in a team, not just for one person?</div>
    <div class="guide-qs">
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>At ExpertVoice, if three people on your team each had a set of agents, what breaks first?</li>
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>Do the agents need to coordinate with each other? With the humans? How do you think about that handoff?</li>
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>Is the friction you see technical, organizational, or both?</li>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-note">This is Greg's question from slide 5. He has real thoughts on it. Let him go first. Marcus listens before sharing how Forge handles it.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <div class="guide-eyebrow">Topic 2, 25 minutes</div>
    <div class="guide-title">What would you trust an agent to do that you do not trust it to do today?</div>
    <div class="guide-qs">
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>Where are you using AI today and where have you decided not to?</li>
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>What would have to change for you to extend that trust further?</li>
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>Marcus shares the agent recruiting and evaluation model. Greg reacts: does that apply, or is evaluating agents a different problem than evaluating people?</li>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-note">Greg flagged slide 7 as genuinely interesting. This is where that conversation lives. The anthropomorphization risk is a real question he wants to explore.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <div class="guide-eyebrow">Topic 3, 20 minutes</div>
    <div class="guide-title">Show, react, move on.</div>
    <div class="guide-qs">
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>Marcus shows one thing: how agents communicate and hand off work in Forge. Under 5 minutes.</li>
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>Greg reacts: does any of this connect to the integration problem you described earlier? Fathom, Slack, Google Docs?</li>
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>If there is time and energy, Marcus shows the agent evaluation flow. Greg reacts.</li>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-note">Keep demos short. The question after each one matters more than the demo itself. Do not prototype live unless Greg brings a simple problem in the moment.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <div class="guide-eyebrow">Close, 10 minutes</div>
    <div class="guide-title">Two honest answers.</div>
    <div class="guide-qs">
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>What is the most important thing either of us said tonight?</li>
      <li><span class="q">Q</span>What should the next conversation be about?</li>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-note">No synthesis slide. No recap. Two answers and done. If Greg goes quiet here, wait him out. He is thinking, not done.</div>
