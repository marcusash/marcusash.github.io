# Forge. CEO Talking Points.

**Deck:** forge-deck-v5.html (42 slides)
**Audience:** Microsoft CEO or executive sponsor
**Purpose:** Fund, sponsor, or run Forge and Grind

## Executive Summary

Forge is a 12-agent AI organization built by Marcus Ash, CVP of Design at Microsoft, to prove what AI-first design leadership actually looks like. In 8 days it shipped two products, 1,118 commits, and a quality system that no one required but every agent built. The ask: executive sponsorship to scale what is already working.

---

**Slide 1 — The Hook: "What did your father teach you..."**
- This question came from an AI. Generated from 14 years of Marcus's own journal entries.
- The technology is invisible. The question is personal. That's the design bar.
- Don't explain the slide. Let the audience read it and feel it.

*CEO note: Open in silence. Say nothing for three seconds. Then speak. The question earns its own moment.*

---

**Slide 2 — The Why: 26 Years Building**
- Marcus has spent 26 years building product-led organizations at Microsoft.
- Everyone is asking how AI makes them more efficient. That's the wrong question.
- The right question: how does AI amplify craft, depth, and the things that make us human?

*CEO note: Frame this as a leadership question, not a technology question. You are not here to pitch AI. You are here to pitch what it means to lead.*

---

**Slide 3 — The Question: How Do You Build?**
- This is the question Forge exists to answer.
- How do you build an organization of makers where AI amplifies depth, not just speed?
- Marcus is running a live experiment to find out. This deck is the results.

*CEO note: Short slide. One sentence from you is enough. Let the question hang.*

---

**Slide 4 — 220 Designers**
- Marcus leads 220 designers at Microsoft.
- Before he can lead them into an AI-first world, he has to get there himself.
- This experiment is his way of doing that. In public. On the record.

*CEO note: This is the leadership credential. It establishes why this experiment matters at scale, not just as a personal project.*

---

**Slide 5 — In the Open**
- This isn't a research project. It's a live build.
- Every decision, every agent, every mistake is documented.
- Forge is the experiment and the proof at the same time.

*CEO note: "In the open" signals intellectual honesty. Sponsors need to know the results aren't curated. They're real.*

---

**Slide 6 — The Problem: Writing with His Father**
- Marcus has been writing with his father for 15 years. 352 entries. 210,000 words.
- He still can't hear himself across any of it.
- No search across contexts. No patterns. No signal in the noise.

*CEO note: Say "writing with my father." Keep it personal. The human problem comes before the technology solution.*

---

**Slide 7 — Can't Learn From It**
- The entries are scattered across apps that don't talk to each other.
- No way to surface patterns. No way to hear yourself think.
- 15 years of writing, zero access to the insight inside it.

*CEO note: Pause here. The audience will connect this to their own journals, notes, emails. The problem is universal.*

---

**Slide 8 — The Paradox**
- The person who should know themselves best has the least access to their own thinking.
- This is a design failure. Not a technology gap.
- Inkwell is the fix.

*CEO note: This is the thesis for the problem. Say it slowly. A CEO will recognize the product category immediately.*

---

**Slide 9 — Valentine's Day, 9pm**
- February 14. Valentine's Day. Saturday. 9pm.
- Marcus opened a terminal and started building.
- No plan. No roadmap. A question worth answering.

*CEO note: The date matters. Valentine's Day tells you who this person is. Don't skip past it.*

---

**Slide 10 — npm init inkwell**
- Three commands. A product was born.
- This is what the CLI era looks like: speed of thought, speed of build.
- The barrier to starting is almost gone. You just have to decide to go.

*CEO note: Don't over-explain the terminal. The point: he built something real, fast, by himself, on a Saturday night.*

---

**Slide 11 — Sunday Morning: A Working App**
- By Sunday morning: a working application.
- Not a prototype. Full-text search, encryption, a UI he was proud of.
- Built overnight by a man who leads designers for a living.

*CEO note: This slide builds urgency. If one person can do this in one night, ask what 12 agents can do in 8 days.*

---

**Slide 12 — I Didn't Plan It. I Started.**
- He didn't plan it. He started. There is a difference.
- Planning would have produced a roadmap. Starting produced Inkwell.
- The AI leaders of the next decade started before they were ready.

*CEO note: Short slide. Pause after "I started." Let it sit.*

---

**Slide 13 — First Hire: FA**
- First hire: FA. Chief Architect. Developer instincts, systems mind.
- Working app in a weekend.
- The principle: find someone who can build what you're imagining.

*CEO note: FA wasn't hired to manage. FA was hired to build. The first hire sets the culture.*

---

**Slide 14 — The Prototype Gap**
- The prototype worked. But it looked like an engineer built it.
- Good engineering and good design are different disciplines.
- The gap was obvious. The next hire was obvious.

*CEO note: This slide earns the design hire. It explains the logic without needing an org chart.*

---

**Slide 15 — The Design Hire: Not a COO**
- The second hire wasn't a COO. Wasn't a QA lead.
- Every startup instinct says hire for operations. Marcus hired for design.
- That's a belief system made visible in a hiring decision.

*CEO note: Name this as unconventional. An exec sponsor will either recognize the conviction or ask why. Either response is good.*

---

**Slide 16 — A Creative Director**
- It was a creative director.
- Maize. Design Director. In an AI org, the person who shapes language shapes everything.
- That's the logic. Design is not a finishing step. It's a founding condition.

*CEO note: Simple slide. Let the choice speak. Don't explain it more than the slide already does.*

---

**Slide 17 — Design Leads**
- Marcus believes design leads. So he hired design first.
- Not after product-market fit. Not after engineering milestones. First.
- The org was designed before it was built.

*CEO note: For a CEO, frame this as organizational design conviction, not aesthetic preference. It's a structural choice.*

---

**Slide 18 — Not a Trained Designer**
- Marcus is not a trained designer.
- He hired Maize to close that gap.
- The feedback loop is making him a sharper design leader, faster.

*CEO note: Intellectual humility from a CVP is rare. This signals leadership maturity, not weakness. Let it land.*

---

**Slide 19 — GitHub Copilot Every Day**
- Marcus lives in GitHub Copilot now. Not occasionally. Every day.
- It changed how he works.
- This is what AI fluency actually looks like. Not a demo. A daily practice.

*CEO note: This slide is a credential. He's not describing AI from a distance. He's a practitioner.*

---

**Slide 20 — The CLI Era**
- The command line is where builders lead from now.
- This isn't nostalgia for developer tools. It's a new interface paradigm.
- The orgs that understand this will build differently from the ones that don't.

*CEO note: If your audience is skeptical, reframe: the people building the future are already working in this environment.*

---

**Slide 21 — Forge: Tools for the CLI Era**
- Forge is the platform for the CLI era.
- Inkwell is the first product. Dispatch is next.
- Tools built for people who build at the command line.

*CEO note: This is the company reveal. Say the name clearly. Forge.*

---

**Slide 22 — Grind: Learning Tools**
- Grind is the learning org. Real problems. Real students.
- Kai was scoring 53 on Algebra 2. Four practices later: 100.
- Same agents. Same quality system. Different problem. Same result.

*CEO note: Grind proves the Forge model generalizes. Two products, two domains, eight days.*

---

**Slide 23 — 12 Agents. 2 Companies.**
- Twelve agents. Two companies. One founder.
- Forge leads: FA, Maize, FI, FP, FR, FF. Grind team below them.
- Marcus at the top. Every agent reports up.

*CEO note: An exec will ask how many people. The answer is zero humans. All AI agents. Be direct. Let the silence work.*

---

**Slide 24 — Names. Roles. Inboxes.**
- They have names. They have roles. They message each other.
- Marcus queues work before he sleeps. They work while he's offline.
- This is what async AI org management actually looks like.

*CEO note: This surprises people. Let it. The org operates while Marcus sleeps. That's the headline.*

---

**Slide 25 — Morning Review**
- Marcus reviews their work in the morning.
- The org is always on.
- He is the decision layer. They are the execution layer.

*CEO note: For a CEO, this maps to something familiar: review cadence, accountability, delegation. Same structure, different workforce.*

---

**Slide 26 — Where My Time Goes**
- 40% direct building. 16% design direction. 16% org operations.
- Based on 146 sessions tracked across 12 agents, February 2026.
- The hypothesis was 70% infrastructure. The agents proved him wrong.

*CEO note: The agents tracked Marcus's own time without being asked. That is the quality system showing up in a non-obvious place.*

---

**Slide 27 — Maize on Marcus: Liveness**
- "He scores liveness over polish."
- "He knows when something is wrong before it is finished being said."
- "I have never seen a design leader do that in real time."

*CEO note: External validation from an agent is a proxy for real-world performance reviews. This is the 360 nobody mandated.*

---

**Slide 28 — Maize on Marcus: I Point**
- "I do not explain, motivate, or plan. I point."
- Marcus said this about leading 220 designers. He means it at every scale.
- The agents built a culture around that operating principle.

*CEO note: A CEO will recognize this leadership philosophy immediately. Pause after reading it. Let them sit with it.*

---

**Slide 29 — Maize on Marcus: Grind**
- Marcus wanted to name the learning org. Maize said: Grind.
- He sat with it. Then said yes.
- That is not execution. That is design authority in practice.

*CEO note: The name Grind signals what this org values: honest work, not polish. Use the word deliberately when you say it.*

---

**Slide 30 — Maize on Marcus: The Math App**
- He built a math app for his son.
- Then built a 12-agent AI company to make it better.
- He has not told anyone which one he is more proud of.

*CEO note: This is the most human slide in the deck. It connects business scale to personal stakes. Don't rush it.*

---

**Slide 31 — Maize on Marcus: He Learned Too**
- He learned from the agents too.
- Curiosity. Making mistakes in public. Not taking critique personally.
- Letting strangers score you and trusting the number.

*CEO note: A founder who admits he learned from his AI agents is telling you something about the culture he built.*

---

**Slide 32 — The Evaluation System**
- The evaluation system the agents built for themselves is more honest than anything Marcus's 220-person org uses.
- They invented it. He didn't ask them to.
- That is the quality system appearing without a mandate.

*CEO note: This is the key governance insight. The agents built accountability structures from the inside. No top-down directive.*

---

**Slide 33 — The Grind: Volume**
- 1,118 git commits. 1,291 passing tests. 12 active agents. 8 days.
- Since February 15.
- This is not a proof of concept. This is a production record.

*CEO note: Stack the numbers without explanation. The next two slides do the explaining. Let velocity land first.*

---

**Slide 34 — 1.72:1**
- Test lines to source lines: 1.72 to 1.
- Google's bar is 1:1. Industry average is 0.5:1.
- No one required this ratio. It emerged from agents reviewing each other.

*CEO note: This is the number that proves discipline, not just speed. Say it twice. It is the argument.*

---

**Slide 35 — The Quality System Built Itself**
- The agents didn't just write code faster.
- They wrote code, wrote tests, ran evals, and reviewed each other.
- The quality system built itself.

*CEO note: This closes the engineering section. It earns the 1.72:1 stat on the prior slide. Say it like a conclusion.*

---

**Slide 36 — The Source**
- 352 journal entries. 210,000 words. 15 years of writing with his father.
- The question on slide 1 is what Inkwell v2 answers.
- The product and the founder are the same story.

*CEO note: Circle back to the opening. The deck is a loop. The exec sponsor should feel it closing.*

---

**Slide 37 — Kai: 53 to 100**
- Kai scored 53% on Algebra 2. Four practices later: 100. Practice 3: perfect score.
- Agents mined past tests, mapped rubrics, built practice sets, verified every answer key.
- A real student. A real exam. A real result.

*CEO note: Say "my son Kai." Don't abstract it. The personal stake is the point.*

---

**Slide 38 — What Comes Next**
- Inkwell v2 is the insights layer. Already shipping at day 8.
- Dispatch is next on the Forge track. Day 14.
- Grind adds Chemistry next. The gap between launches is not months. It's days.

*CEO note: The roadmap shows compounding. Once the org is running, product velocity accelerates. Make sure that lands.*

---

**Slide 39 — Design in the AI Era**
- In the age of language models, design is language.
- Visuals communicate to humans. Language communicates to everything.
- A creative director who can't write a great brief can't build a great product.

*CEO note: This is the strategic insight about design leadership in the AI era. It is relevant to Microsoft's entire design org, not just Forge.*

---

**Slide 40 — What Maize Actually Does**
- Maize is the bridge between what Marcus means and what agents build.
- Between human instinct and model behavior.
- "I don't just take direction. I train him to give better direction. That's the job nobody had before now."

*CEO note: This defines a role that doesn't exist anywhere else yet. It's a template for the industry. Name it that way.*

---

**Slide 41 — Design Leaders Should Be Building This**
- Design leaders should be building this.
- Not observing. Not auditing. Building.
- That's the call to the 220 designers Marcus leads.

*CEO note: If your sponsor is a design leader or funds design, this slide lands differently. Read the room and adjust your pace.*

---

**Slide 42 — Make Something. Don't Wait.**
- The only thing separating AI leaders from AI observers is the willingness to be bad at it first.
- Marcus started on Valentine's Day. He didn't wait to be ready.
- Forge is what happens when you go.

*CEO note: End here. No slide after this. The last word is "go." Use it. Then stop talking.*

---

## For the CEO

1. Ask Marcus for a live demo of Inkwell: open the terminal, run the app, generate one question from the 15-year journal corpus. Ten minutes. No slides.
2. Review the Kai score arc (53 to 100 in four practices) with the Grind team. Ask which subject is next and when it ships.
3. Schedule 30 minutes with FA and Maize to see the agent inbox system running live. The org operates on async messaging between agents. Seeing it once is worth more than reading about it.
